# Machine learning on Pulsars dataset

### Intro to probelm
This is my final project for my *Advanced Data Science and Machine Learning* module at the University of Bristol, due 02/04/2025. It looks at using different classifcation algorithms to detect Pulsars from a given dataset.

I compare 3 supervised algorithms SVM, BLR and Random Forests (brief look at decision trees too). They all perform well after preprocessing. I also compare to a KMeans algorithm with K=2 clustering to see if the pulsars can be predicted by unsupervised learning
